## Overview

My wife's family competes in an annual Oscar pool. Unsatisfied with the inefficiency of exchanging sheets of paper, I created this web app. Participates join pools, make their picks, then are able to view their standings live in realtime on Oscar night.

## Technologies Used

- **Ionic**: UI mobile first Framework with the option to create an app
- **Angular**: Tried and true front-end framework
- **Firebase**: For realtime changes on Oscar night
